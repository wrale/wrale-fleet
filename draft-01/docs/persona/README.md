## Validation Guidelines

1. Each journey must be validated end-to-end
2. All prerequisites must be complete before starting
3. Only human operators may mark items complete
4. Failed validations must include:
   - Failure description
   - Reproduction steps
   - System state
   - Error messages/logs
   - Impact analysis
