## Validation Guidelines

1. Each journey must be tested end-to-end
2. All sub-steps must be completed in sequence
3. Only a human operator may mark items as complete
4. Prerequisites must be validated before starting a journey
5. Failed validations must include:
   - Detailed failure description
   - Steps to reproduce
   - System state at time of failure
   - Any error messages or logs
   - Impact on dependent journeys
